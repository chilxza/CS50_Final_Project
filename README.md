#### Description: 

##### Background:
    I am an amateur Go player in Thailand. Go is a mind sport where two players aim to surround more territory than the opponent. The game was invented in China more than 4,500 years ago. In this project, I have developed a Web application that visualizes **GAT-point** data of all **Dan** players in Thailand. GAT-point measures the players' Go strengths in Thailand, similar to the Elo rating. The **Dan** is the level of the players. For amateur players, there are 7 Dan levels (1-7). 
    The GAT-point data is updated twice a month on Google Sheets by the Thailand Go Association. The data is about a four-year span, with almost 1000 Dan players. It is not easy to view the insight of this data on Google Sheets. Therefore, this project promotes the Go game to the Thai community and enables all Dan players in Thailand to view their status, progress, and ranking in charts.

###### Data Preparation
A Python program named "data_cleanning.py" is written to download the current GAT-point data for the year 2023 from [Google Sheets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14SMzCtmljfmfT2OpVxmrN0XrBb1P4hCU/view) in a CSV format. Pandas library is used to clean the data to remove unnecessary data, correct wrong-spaced column names, handle missing/wrong data, and format data so that it is easy to analyze. The data in the year 2023 is merged with the CSV data files from previous years (2020-2022). The output of this process is a cleaned CSV data file named "thaigo-all.csv".

###### Data Analysis and Visualization
The data is analyzed and visualized on a Website using Python programs with Pandas, Plotly and Streamlit libraries. There are three main files in this Web application.
- **dashboard.py** - Display information on a dashboard page, such as the number of Dan players in Thailand, the percentage number of male/female Dan players, and the new Dan players each year. 
- **1_üëèüèªTop_N_Ranking_Players_(By_GAT-Point).py** - It will display Top N-ranking players (All, Male, Female players) based on their GAT-point. Users can choose the Top N-ranking players using a slider UI. This page will display a list of player's data in the table. 
- **2_üîçSearch_Players_(By_Name).py** - Users can search the player's data by entering their name or surname. Then, this web page will display a line chart of the history of a player's Gat-Point for the selected year.
