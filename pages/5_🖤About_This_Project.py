    "This project involves developing an information system related to processing and analyzing GAT Point scores, as well as displaying statistics of various Go players. Including gender, rank level, individual GAT Point score history, and ranking the skill levels of players. The information is displayed in an easy-to-understand format using Interactive Graphs (Data Visualization)."

From there, I developed this web application to visualize GAT Point of Go players in Thailand. GAT Point web will let Go players know their status, progress, and ranking in Thailand. Last, I hope this web application will inspire Go players to continuously improve their Go capabilities and benefit the Thailand Go community.üñ§ü§ç"
