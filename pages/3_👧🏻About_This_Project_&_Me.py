    "In this project, I visualize GAT Point (a scoring to estimate the players' Go strengths in Thailand) which is stored in the Google Sheets and updated by Thailand Go Association. The data downloaded in csv format. Then I wrote a Python program to clean the data. After that, I did an data analysis and visualize the data using Python program. Next we visualize that data on the website using Plotly and Streamlit libraries. This webiste is composed of three main pages: Dashboard, Top N ranking by GAT Point, and Search Players."

From there, I developed this web application to visualize GAT Point of Go players in Thailand. GAT Point web will let Go players know their status, progress, and ranking in Thailand. Last, I hope this web application will inspire Go players to continuously improve their Go capabilities and benefit the Thailand Go community.üñ§ü§ç"
